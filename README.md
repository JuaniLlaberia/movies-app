## Movies Application Project

This was my first "big" project using React after having finished the Meta Front-End Certification and having done some small projects. I wanted to create a web application where users could view the most popular movies and shows, search for the ones they like and be able to see where to watch them. Also implement a favorite system where users could saved content and access on other devices and still have their preferences by having an user in our web.
With React, I was able to built a interactive and dynamic application by using hooks, the context API, routing. To be able to have the data needed for this, the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API was used, to retrieve all the information needed about movies, series and casts. 
I addition I implemented the authentication and favorite movies storage in Google Firebase (Firebase Auth & Firestore).
